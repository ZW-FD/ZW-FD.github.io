- <strong>Ansel Chau</strong>: An Empirical Study on the Accuracy of Analysts' Long-term Earnings Forecast. 

<strong>Abstract</strong> This study employs a suite of advanced machine learning algorithms to examines the accuracy and influencing factors of analysts' long-term earnings forecasts for Chinese A-share companies. The findings reveal that analysts outperform statistical models in short-term but exhibit suboptimal performance in long-term forecast. Corporate financial characteristics emerge as the most influential factor affecting forecast accuracy, while the impact of non-financial characteristics and analyst-specific attributes gradually strengthens over time, particularly in cyclical industries.

- <strong>Ansel Chau</strong>: Returns on Pre-IPO Investments in China. 

<strong>Abstract</strong> The study examines Pre-IPO investment returns in China's stock issuance registration system reform, finding that Pre-IPO investment still yields considerable returns, though decreasing. The study innovatively decomposes the returns of Pre-IPO investment into the listing gains from the primary market and the capital gains from the secondary market. Primary market returns driven by successful listing, while secondary market returns are much lower and primarily related to profitability (negative impact) and solvency (positive impact).

- <strong>Ansel Chau</strong>: The Drivers and Outcomes of Pre-listing Equity Incentives: Evidence from China's Growth Enterprise Market. 

<strong>Abstract</strong> This paper investigates the motivations and effects of pre-listing equity incentives in Chinese Growth Enterprise Market-listed companies. The finding indicate that high-growth firms with strong cost control and younger workforces are more likely to adopt such incentives, which significantly enhance pre-listing performance and attracting investor attention. However, private equity participation and strategic emerging industry status may weaken the impact of these incentives.
